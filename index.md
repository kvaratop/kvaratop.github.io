## 📝 About Me  
![Image Description](https://kvaratop.github.io/photo.jpeg)  

I have been involved in cybersecurity for 7 years and have 5 years of industry experience as a Security Operations Specialist working in the National SOC. SIEM is my best friend.  

I am proficient in Linux and Windows environments (including Active Directory). My expertise extends to network and host forensics, intrusion detection, and anomaly monitoring.  

Beyond my hands-on experience, I actively share my knowledge through cybersecurity training, specifically for Ukraine's Critical Infrastructure sectors.  

I consistently participate in CTF competitions and real-world cyber defense exercises to enhance my skills. 🏆
