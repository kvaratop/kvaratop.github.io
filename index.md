## 📝 About Me
![Image Description](https://kvaratop.github.io/photo.jpeg)

I have been involved in cybersecurity for 7 years with 5 years of industry experience as a SOC Analyst. SIEM - is my best friend. 

I am proficient in Linux and Windows environments (including Active Directory). My expertise extends to network and host forensics, intrusion detection, and anomaly monitoring. 

Beyond my hands-on experience, I've shared my knowledge through cybersecurity training specifically for Ukraine's Critical Infrastructure sectors. 

To enhance my skills, I consistently participate in CTF competitions. 🏆
